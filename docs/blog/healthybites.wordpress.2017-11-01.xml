		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People love to ask me why I became a dietitian. I weren’t always sure why...

<strong><em>I am not even always sure that I chose it as much as it chose me...</em></strong>

When I look back it is as if life was always busy preparing me for that day... I grew up on a farm in the northern regions of South Africa. As a child I had the opportunity to regularly eat fresh home grown food.

Neither of my parents had any experience in the health industry, yet they had so much wisdom of how to raise healthy kids. Sweets were something we only ate on special occasions, and fruits and yogurt were our snacks. Take-away foods and eating out was also really out of the ordinary. Home cooking was part of our daily routine. Before I could write my own name I was able to peel a potato, and by the time I was a teenager my sister and I took turns to cook for our family.

<strong><em>Everybody in my  family always believed that it is important to live healthy and avoid toxins in your body.</em></strong>

I was fourteen years old when my dad told me and my sister that we had better be careful, because girls tend to pick up weight at our age. At first it made me angry that he could dare say such a thing, but then it got me thinking. For the first time in my life I got up every morning and went for a jog.

<strong><em>I took care of what I put in my mouth, and even though I wasn’t overweight, I lost all my baby fat...</em></strong>

During the same year my grandfather became very sick and couldn’t eat normally and was given specialised nutrition formulas. This was my first exposure to the medical side of nutrition.

When I had to choose a career, I wasn’t really sure what I should do. My one grandma said I should become a nurse, because I always wanted to help people, and the other said I should be a chef because I loved cooking.

While I was researching careers in the medical industry, I came upon dietetics. After talking to some dietetic students I knew it was the right career path for me and never regretted it for a second!

<strong><em>Dietetics allows me to help people live healthier, and improve their quality of life and longevity.</em></strong>

The fact that what you eat influences your health always intrigued me. We all need to eat, but what if your choice could either keep you healthy or make you ill? What if our fast-food culture is killing us slowly?

The fact is that it is in your power to live a healthier life, by just deciding what you put into your mouth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-77" src="http://healthy-bites.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/girl-1263651_1280-1-169x300.jpg" alt="girl-1263651_1280" width="112" height="198" />If I asked you, who you would like to look like, what would you say? You’ll probably say some movie star, model or athlete. If I asked your how happy you are with the way you look, what will your answer be?

I wonder if we were to ask the people whose names and bodies popped into our heads with the first few questions how happy they are with their bodies, what their answers would’ve been?

So many of us build our identity around the way we look. We will rather be friends with pretty people than less attractive people. We can’t really help it since we are bombarded by the media of all these ‘perfect’ people.  If you start to diet and train, and wear those clothes you want to, you will probably feel a bit better for a while. But if you look deeply into your heart, do you really feel that good about yourself? Isn’t that empty feeling still there?

The point I am trying to make is that we tend to build our identity on false ideas. How sure are you that your role model really looks that amazing every second of each day? How sure can one be there wasn’t a pimple that was removed by Photoshop?

Sometime we even do it with our friends on social media, you look at all the beautiful pictures and happy status updates, and then you compare your ‘behind the scenes’ with their happy highlights!

We have to take care of ourselves, and our body does matter. We have to eat healthy and exercise. The only thing is that we have to do it for the right reasons. We cannot do it to try and impress people, or with the belief that if I could only dress better or be thinner I will be accepted. You have to do it because you want to be a healthy human being, or because you want to have more energy, or to be able to enjoy a fuller and better life.

If you do it for other people you will always end up feeling empty, even if you do succeed. You first have to accept yourself with all your flaws, and only then you can start improving on them. You were created beautiful, perfect and unique. No one will ever be a better you than you!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Detox your life</title>
		<link>http://healthy-bites.co.za/2016/09/26/detox-your-life/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We live in a consumer driven age, in a consumer driven world. Everything needs to be quick and easy, and if it’s not, we are not interested. So we do the same with our health. A 3-day detox, or a 2 week diet. We do not realise how much damage the diet culture is doing to our health.

<em><strong>We came to a point where people are willing to damage their health just to be thin...</strong></em>

&nbsp;

While you are following your diet you usually lose weight, but the moment when you go back to your ‘normal’ diet you just gain it all back. This is because quick diets do not teach us anything about healthy eating. It’s as if food became your enemy. You love food, but you are also terrified of eating something that is not ‘healthy’. Just to eat a whole slab of chocolate when no one is looking!

<strong><em>Ignore your health and it will go away.</em></strong>

&nbsp;

Food was created to nourish your body and give you energy. Unfortunately we listen to people that tells us to avoid healthy food because suddenly those are ‘bad’ foods.

<em><strong>The truth is that there are no ‘bad’ foods, only bad diets.</strong></em>

&nbsp;

We need to detoxify our minds from negative thoughts around food. We need to detox from processed foods. We need to start eating a more balanced diet and make it a lifestyle. Eat less from a box and more from the earth.

<em><strong>Stop bouncing between diets and make a lasting change by building healthy habits.</strong></em>

&nbsp;

The crazy thing is that you can sometimes eat less healthy and still be healthy. Yes you can eat cake on your birthday! It is the things that you do every day, as well as the things that you abstain from doing every day that matters.

&nbsp;

<strong><em>So what are you suppose to do?</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Eat breakfast</li>
 	<li>Small frequent meals</li>
 	<li>Eat vegetables every day</li>
 	<li>Snack on fruit, yogurt not sweets/ biscuits</li>
 	<li>Avoid chips, rather eat popcorn</li>
 	<li>Avoid refined carbs</li>
 	<li>Replace animal fat with plant fats</li>
 	<li>Portion control</li>
 	<li>Eat from a smaller plate</li>
 	<li>Eat with family</li>
 	<li>Plan meals</li>
 	<li>Drink 6-8 glasses of water</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

It is important to remember that we are all different and medical conditions have to be considered. In all cases, balance is the key.]]></content:encoded>

You need to fix your relationship with food. Food was created to nourish your body and to be enjoyed in the right way. Not to be abused. You need to fix your relationship with food. You cannot use it as a tool to make you feel better when you are down or needs comfort. Balance is the key, whenever you exaggerate anything it becomes unhealthy.

<strong>Too much of a good thing isn’t always that great.</strong>

Being healthy is not about eating only leaves and drinking water for the rest of your life. It’s about finding the balance between all the FAD’s and information flying over your head.

I am a firm believer that if your favourite thing in the world is chocolate cake, and I forbid you to ever touch it again in your life, I am fighting a losing battle. Where as if I teach you clever ways to control your sugar cravings, and sensitize your taste buds to sugar, it might actually make a difference. It is better to stick to the healthy guidelines 90 % of the time, and then on your birthday or special occasion you enjoy a slice of your favourite chocolate cake!

That is why diets do not work! It has to be a lifestyle change. People will always cheat on diets, or they will follow a strict diet for a month, loose a few kilos and just put it back on, or worse even, double it! The emphasis can never be on weight-loss only.

<strong>Our health is something that cannot be bought, and once lost it can never be retrieved. </strong>

We need to focus on health, and then the weight loss will follow. Let’s say you are overweight, yes, for you to be healthy you do need to lose weight, but is it reasonable to expect to drop it in a week if it took you years to gain it? What about your body systems, how are they supposed to react? You send your whole system into shock , your body enters ‘starvation mode’ and your metabolism slows down. This causes your body to store energy as fat the moment it gets access to it.

So what is the magic diet then? Unfortunately or in my opinion fortunately, there is none. You need to commit yourself to a lifetime of making the right choices. As with most worthwhile things in life, it won’t come without effort and it will take time. But believe me, once you got into it, you will love it so much, and you wouldn’t want to stop!

<strong>Then probably the most important question of all: Do you really want this?</strong>

How badly do you want to be healthy? Do you only think you want it, or do you actually truly have the intense desire to be as healthy as possible? If the answer is yes, you also need to ask yourself the question, why? Your why is extremely important, because that will cause you to either succeed or to fail. If you want to do it to impress your neighbour, you can stop right now. But if you truly believe that for you to be a healthy happy individual you also need to have a healthy body, please go ahead, you are on the right track.]]></content:encoded>
