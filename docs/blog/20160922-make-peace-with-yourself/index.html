			<div id="post-content">
				<p>If I asked you, who you would like to look like, what would you say? You’ll probably say some movie star, model or athlete. If I asked your how happy you are with the way you look, what will your answer be?</p>

<p>I wonder if we were to ask the people whose names and bodies popped into our heads with the first few questions how happy they are with their bodies, what their answers would’ve been?</p>

<p>So many of us build our identity around the way we look. We will rather be friends with pretty people than less attractive people. We can’t really help it since we are bombarded by the media of all these ‘perfect’ people.  If you start to diet and train, and wear those clothes you want to, you will probably feel a bit better for a while. But if you look deeply into your heart, do you really feel that good about yourself? Isn’t that empty feeling still there?</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that we tend to build our identity on false ideas. How sure are you that your role model really looks that amazing every second of each day? How sure can one be there wasn’t a pimple that was removed by Photoshop?</p>

<p>Sometime we even do it with our friends on social media, you look at all the beautiful pictures and happy status updates, and then you compare your ‘behind the scenes’ with their happy highlights!</p>

<p>We have to take care of ourselves, and our body does matter. We have to eat healthy and exercise. The only thing is that we have to do it for the right reasons. We cannot do it to try and impress people, or with the belief that if I could only dress better or be thinner I will be accepted. You have to do it because you want to be a healthy human being, or because you want to have more energy, or to be able to enjoy a fuller and better life.</p>

<p>If you do it for other people you will always end up feeling empty, even if you do succeed. You first have to accept yourself with all your flaws, and only then you can start improving on them. You were created beautiful, perfect and unique. No one will ever be a better you than you!</p>
