We live in a consumer driven age, in a consumer driven world. Everything needs to be quick and easy, and if it’s not, we are not interested. So we do the same with our health. A 3-day detox, or a 2 week diet. We do not realise how much damage the diet culture is doing to our health.

**We came to a point where people are willing to damage their health just to be thin...**

While you are following your diet you usually lose weight, but the moment when you go back to your ‘normal’ diet you just gain it all back. This is because quick diets do not teach us anything about healthy eating. It’s as if food became your enemy. You love food, but you are also terrified of eating something that is not ‘healthy’. Just to eat a whole slab of chocolate when no one is looking!

**Ignore your health and it will go away.**

Food was created to nourish your body and give you energy. Unfortunately we listen to people that tells us to avoid healthy food because suddenly those are ‘bad’ foods.

**The truth is that there are no ‘bad’ foods, only bad diets.**

We need to detoxify our minds from negative thoughts around food. We need to detox from processed foods. We need to start eating a more balanced diet and make it a lifestyle. Eat less from a box and more from the earth.

**Stop bouncing between diets and make a lasting change by building healthy habits.**

The crazy thing is that you can sometimes eat less healthy and still be healthy. Yes you can eat cake on your birthday! It is the things that you do every day, as well as the things that you abstain from doing every day that matters.

**So what are you suppose to do?**
-Eat breakfast
-Small frequent meals
-Eat vegetables every day
-Snack on fruit, yogurt not sweets/ biscuits
-Avoid chips, rather eat popcorn
-Avoid refined carbs
-Replace animal fat with plant fats
-Portion control
-Eat from a smaller plate
-Eat with family
-Plan meals
-Drink 6-8 glasses of water

It is important to remember that we are all different and medical conditions have to be considered. In all cases, balance is the key.
